# App

The app displays user-specific [PGx](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) information.

Once the user imports their genomic data into the app,
[PGx](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) guidelines matching the user's genetic profile are
displayed.

Users can review their gene results [(a), (b)], search for drugs (c), and receive
information about whether a drug can be used at standard dose or if the
treatment may need to be changed (d).

Anytreatment changes should be approved by a pharmacist or physician as well.
To inform the physician of the [PGx](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) results, the
application offers to export a detailed description.

PGx report | Gene details | Drug search | Drug details |
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
(a) | (b) | (c) | (d) |
