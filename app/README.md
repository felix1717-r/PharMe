# App

The app displays user-specific [PGx](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) information.

Once the user imports their genomic data into the app general
[PGx](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) guidelines can be filtered to fit the genomic
variation of the user.

The user can then search for drugs and receives information about whether the
drug can be used with a standard dose or if the treatment should be changed. Any
treatment changes should be approved by a physician as well. To inform the
physician of the [pharmacogenomic](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) situation the
application offers to export a detailed description.  Further, the application
offers a report about potentially dangerous or unsuitable
[drugs](../docs/GLOSSARY.md).  To ensure a general comprehension of
[PGx](../docs/GLOSSARY.md) and data security the app provides additional
information on a FAQ page.  You can see the mentioned pages in the table below.
