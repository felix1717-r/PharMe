# Annotation Interface

The Annotation Interface is the curator's interface to our [Annotation
Server](../annotation-server). It is one way of administering the Annotation
Server's data without the need of technical expertise by providing a
comprehensible interface to fetch external data and curate
[annotations](../docs/GLOSSARY.md). Additional instructions are given within the
interface.

> Please note that the Annotation Interface is not currently deployed, meaning
> its only available by setting it up locally. See the [Contribution
> Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to set it up.
