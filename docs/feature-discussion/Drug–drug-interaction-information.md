## Gene page

Description in header.

_Open questions:_

* Meaningful here?
* Also show brand names for medication list? (Could also build drug card list,
  but might never be found)
* Also show indicator in affected drugs in gene list? (Though not feeling like
  this would be useful information here)

## Drug selection (after onboarding)

Currently **not** shown here; it feels like too much information when first
opening the app.

_Open questions:_

* Should also show here, as in drug search?
