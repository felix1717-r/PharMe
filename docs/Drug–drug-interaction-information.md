##  Open Questions

* Meaningful on drug search page?
* Meaningful on drug detail page?
* Meaningful on gene page?
   * Also show brand names for medication list? (Could also build drug card list, but might never be found)
   * Also ﻿show indicator in affected drugs in gene list? (Though not feeling like this would be useful information here)
   * Should also show indicator in drug selection? (﻿Though it feels like too much information when first opening the app)
