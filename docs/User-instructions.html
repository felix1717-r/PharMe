<h1>Getting Started with PharMe</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to PharMe, an application to gain insights on your DNA's influence
    on medications! üß¨üíäü§ó
</p>
<p>
    In the following, we will give you an overview on how to use the app.
    Please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:pgx-app-validation-study@lists.myhpi.de">pgx-app-validation-study@lists.myhpi.de</a>
    in case you have any questions.
</p>
<p>
    We hope you will enjoy using PharMe! üéâ

    To get started with PharMe, you first need to import your pharmacogenomic
    (PGx) test data (data about your DNA and medications you are taking) from your
    data provider.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tapping the <i>Get data</i> button will forward you to
    your data provider's sign in.

</td>

    After successfully importing data, you will get an overview about PharMe's
    background and capabilities in a short onboarding.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In the initial medication selection you can tell PharMe which medications
    you are currently taking ‚Äì if your PGx test data includes current
    medications, they will be pre-selected here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Later in the app, you will be able to filter for medications you are
    currently taking; also, some medications can influence your results for
    other medications. Please take your time here to make the most of PharMe. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

    Afterwards, you reach the main app; everything is set up
    now. (Yay! ü•≥)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The first page you will see is the <i>Report</i> screen; here you can see
    the results from your your PGx test by gene (we know the names are cryptic,
    but you will get to know them sooner as you think!).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Under each gene name, your phenotype is depicted. The phenotype tells you
    what the consequence of your genetic variant is; e.g., as a <i>CYP2C19
    Intermediate Metabolizer</i>, your CYP2C19 enzyme ‚Äì the protein that is
    encoded by the CYP2C19 gene ‚Äì works a bit slower than expected.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Selecting a gene will take you to its detail page, with further information
    about your result and medications that are influenced by this gene. For
    technical terms (like "genotype"), you can always find explanations by
    tapping on the question mark.

</div>
</td>

    You can also view your PGx results by medications on the <i>Medications</i>
    screen. Here, you can search for medications by their generic name, brand
    names, or class. You can also filter the list by medications you are
    currently taking and by guideline result (‚ùå consider alternatives,
    ‚ö†Ô∏è use with caution, and ‚úÖ standard precautions).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Selecting a medication (also on the gene detail page) leads to the
    medication's page with further details.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Here you see some general information about the medication and a short
    statement what PGx guidelines say about your DNA and this medication. For
    more information, the respective guideline is linked at the bottom of each
    medication page.

    The <i>FAQ</i> page collects information that might be useful for you.

    If you want to view the onboarding again or review our Terms of Use or
    Privacy Policy, you can find the information you need on the <i>More</i>
    tab.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Please be careful when deleting your data; this will reset the app in its
    initial state and also delete your PGx test data. It might not be possible
    to import your data again, if you lost your credentials or your data
    provider deleted your data.
