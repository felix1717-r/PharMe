        <h3>Welcome to PharMe!</h3>
        <p>Did you know? Your genes help decide how medications work in your body.</p>

                Your genes are just one piece of the puzzle. Many things affect

            PharMe tells you if your genes might make certain medications work
            differently than expected, cause unwanted side effects, or not work
            well enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            This field of medicine is called pharma-co-genomics (PGx).

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em">About Gene Testing and Pharmacogenomics (PGx)</h3>
<hr>

<h4>What is pharmacogenomics (PGx)?</h4>
<p>
    PGx (short for pharma-co-genomics) explores how your genes affect how
    medications work in your body. 
</p>
<p>
    Think of your genes like a recipe book that tells your body how to make
    important proteins. These proteins help:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Move medications through your body</li>
    <li>Break down medications to digest them to less active versions</li>
    <li>Activate medications my changing them to make them work in your body</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the gene version you carry, these proteins may work faster or
    slower than expected.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if a protein that activates a medication
    works slower than expected, the medication may not work properly for you
    because you do not have enough working versions of the medication in your
    body. In such a case, you might need a higher dose of the medication or
    might need to use a different medication.
</p>

<h4>Why is pharmacogenomics (PGx) important?</h4>
<p>
    PGx helps pharmacists and doctors pick the right medications and doses for
    you. It can help avoid bad reactions to medications before you even take
    them. But remember:

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
            <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece disclaimer-icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div>
            Your genes are just one piece of the puzzle. Many things affect
            how medications work, like your weight, age, other health
            conditions, or other medications you are taking.
        </div>
    </div>
</p>

<h4>What can cause bad reactions to medications?</h4>
<p>
    You might have a bad reaction to medication for several reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allergies</span>: Sometimes your body thinks a medication is harmful and
            fights against it. This can cause an upset stomach, itchy skin, or
            in rare cases, very serious reactions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Genes</span>: Your genes affect how your body handles medications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown causes</span>: Sometimes people have rare reactions that
            pharmacists and doctors don't yet understand.
        </li>
    </ul>
    You can have more than one type of reaction at the same time. For example,
    you might have both an allergy AND a reaction because of your genes.
</p>

<h4>Does PharMe show all possible gene-related reactions?</h4>
<p>
    No. Scientists are still finding new ways that genes affect medications. Different labs might also interpret gene tests differently as this is a new science.
</p>
<p>
    PharMe uses trusted guidelines from medical experts (CPIC and FDA) to give you the most up-to-date information. Therefore:

        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-dna dna-icon-with-sub-icon"></i>

        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-circle-check disclaimer-sub-icon dna-sub-icon"></i>
    </div>
    <p class="disclaimer-text">PharMe only includes genes that are known to affect how medications are processed according to CPIC and FDA guidelines.</p>
</div>

<h4>What do my gene results mean?</h4>
<p>
    Your results show two things:
    <ul>
        <li>Your gene versions (called <span style="font-weight: bold;">genotype</span>): You have two copies for one gene, one from your mom and one from your dad. One gene copy is called an "allele".</li>
        <li>How your genes affect your body (called <span style="font-weight: bold;">phenotype</span>): in pharmacogenomics (PGx), it usually shows if a gene version might cause a bad reaction to a medication or how fast your body processes a drug.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="reviewer-comment">in the App the "the learn about genomics, or in the App" part will be omitted</p>

<h4>Which medications does PharMe include?</h4>
<div class="disclaimer">
    <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-pills pills-icon-with-sub-icon"></i>
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-circle disclaimer-sub-icon-background pills-sub-icon-background"></i>
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-circle-check disclaimer-sub-icon pills-sub-icon"></i>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="disclaimer-text">PharMe only includes medications that are known to be affected by genes. We get this information from clinical guidelines from CPIC and the FDA.</p>
        <p class="disclaimer-text" style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 1em;">
            While only to a small percentage of medications have CPIC or FDA guidelines, they are among the most commonly prescribed ones.
            If you cannot find a medication in PharMe, there may not be enough evidence for meaningful gene interactions.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Some examples are medications for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blood clots</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>High cholesterol</li>
    <li>Acid reflux</li>
    <li>Pain</li>
    <li>Fungal infections</li>
    <li>Immune system</li>
    <li>Cancer</li>
</ul>

<h4>Can other medications change my results?</h4>
<p>
    Yes. Some medications can change how your body handles other medications. They can slow down or speed up how your body processes medications.
</p>
<p>PharMe will warn you when this might happen.</p>
<p>
    Medications that slow down how your body processes medications are called "inhibitors". Medications that speed these processes up are called "inducers". They can have a strong effect or a moderate effect on genes.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that PharMe only changes your results if medications have a strong effect and only and warns you of medications have a moderate effect. Consult your pharmacist or doctor in such cases.
</p>
<p>
    The following medications are included in PharMe that can change your results:
</p>
<p class="reviewer-comment">Will also leave out gene names in App FAQ (currently only CYP2D6 anyways)</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Strong inhibitors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bupropion (brand names: Aplenzin, Auvelity, Budeprion, Contrave, Forfivo, Wellbutrin, Zyban)</li>
    <li>Fluoxetine (brand names: Act Fluoxetine, Prozac, Sarafem, Symbyax)</li>
    <li>Paroxetine (brand names: Paxil, Pexeva)</li>
    <li>Quinidine (brand names: Nuedexta)</li>
    <li>Terbinafine (brand names: Lamisil, Silka Cream)</li>

    <li>Lorcaserin (brand names: Belvia)</li>
    <li>Mirabegron (brand names: Myrbetriq)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Will my results affect my family?</h4>
<p>
    Yes. Since genes run in families:
    <ul>
        <li>You got your gene versions from your parents</li>
        <li>Your children will get their gene versions from you</li>
        <li>Your brothers and sisters might have similar gene versions</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Who should I share my results with?</h4>
<p>
    Share your results with:
    <ul>
        <li>Your doctors</li>
        <li>Your pharmacists</li>
        <li>Close family members</li>
    </ul>
