        <h3>Welcome to PharMe!</h3>
        <p>Did you know? Your genes help decide how medications work in your body.</p>
        <p>In fact, 9 out of 10 people might react differently to medications than expected.</p>
        <p>PharMe helps you understand how your genes affect your medications.</p>

                Your genes are just one piece of the puzzle. Many things affect
                how medications work, like your weight, age, other health
                conditions, or other medications you are taking.

        <h3>Genome Power Unlocked to Improve Your Health</h3>
        <p>
            PharMe tells you if your genes might make certain medications work
            differently than expected, cause unwanted side effects, or not work
            well enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            This field of medicine is called pharma-co-genomics (PGx).

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em">1. About the PharMe App</h3>

<h4>1.1 What does PharMe do?</h4>
<p>PharMe helps you understand how your genes affect your medications.</p>
<p>It shows which medications might not work well for you and might cause side effects.</p>
<p>However, please remember:</p>
<div class="disclaimer" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
    <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece disclaimer-icon"></i>
    </div>
    <div>
        Your genes are just one piece of the puzzle. Many things affect
        how medications work, like your weight, age, other health
        conditions, or other medications you are taking.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="disclaimer">

    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="disclaimer-text">PharMe only includes medications that are known to be affected by genes according to CPIC and FDA guidelines.</p>
        <p class="disclaimer-text" style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 1em;">
            While only a small percentage of medications have CPIC or FDA guidelines, they are among the most commonly prescribed medications.
            If you cannot find a medication in PharMe, there may not be enough evidence for clinically relevant gene interactions.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h4>1.2 Can I use PharMe without talking to my pharmacist or doctor?</h4>
<p>
    No. Always talk to your pharmacist or doctor before starting, changing, or stopping your medications.
    <div class="disclaimer">
        <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
            <span class="material-icons-round disclaimer-icon">warning</span>
        </div>
        <div>
            Never change or stop your medications without talking to your
            pharmacist or doctor first.
        </div>
    </div>
</p>

<h4>1.3 Where does PharMe get its information?</h4>
<p>
    PharMe uses trusted clinical guidelines from medical experts (CPIC and FDA). Our experts made these guidelines easier to understand.
</p>

        <li>Asking you to log in again if you do not use the App for some time</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1em">2. About Gene Testing and PGx (Pharmacogenomics)</h3>

<h4>2.1 What is PGx (pharmacogenomics)?</h4>
<div class="disclaimer">
    <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
        <span class="material-icons-round disclaimer-icon">info</span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">PGx</span>
        (pharma-co-genomics) is the medical field of how your genes
        affect how medications work in your body.
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Think of your genes like a recipe book that tells your body how to make
    important proteins. These proteins help:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Move medications through your body</li>
    <li>Break down medications to digest them to less active versions</li>
    <li>Activate medications my changing them to make them work in your body</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the gene version you carry, these proteins may work faster or
    slower than expected.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if a protein that activates a medication
    works slower than expected, the medication may not work properly for you
    because you do not have enough working versions of the medication in your
    body. In such a case, you might need a higher dose of the medication or
    might need to use a different medication.
</p>

<h4>2.2 Why is PGx (pharmacogenomics) important?</h4>
<p>
    PGx helps pharmacists and doctors pick the right medications and doses for
    you. It can help avoid bad reactions to medications before you even take
    them. But remember:

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
            <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece disclaimer-icon"></i>
        </div>
        <div>
            Your genes are just one piece of the puzzle. Many things affect
            how medications work, like your weight, age, other health
            conditions, or other medications you are taking.
        </div>
    </div>
</p>

<h4>2.3 What can cause bad reactions to medications?</h4>
<p>
    You might have a bad reaction to medication for several reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allergies</span>: Sometimes your body thinks a medication is harmful and
            fights against it. This can cause an upset stomach, itchy skin, or
            in rare cases, very serious reactions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Genes</span>: Your genes affect how your body handles medications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown causes</span>: Sometimes people have rare reactions that
            pharmacists and doctors don't yet understand.
        </li>
    </ul>
    You can have more than one type of reaction at the same time. For example,
    you might have both an allergy AND a reaction because of your genes.
</p>

<h4>2.4 Does PharMe show all possible gene-related reactions?</h4>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    No. Scientists are still finding new ways that genes affect medications.
</p>
<p>Different labs might also interpret gene tests differently as this is a new science.</p>
<p>
    PharMe uses trusted clinical guidelines from medical experts (CPIC and FDA) to give you the most up-to-date information. Therefore:
</p>
<div class="disclaimer">
    <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-dna dna-icon-with-sub-icon"></i>
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-circle disclaimer-sub-icon-background dna-sub-icon-background"></i>

    </div>
    <p class="disclaimer-text">PharMe only includes genes that are known to affect how medications are processed according to CPIC and FDA guidelines.</p>
</div>

<h4>2.5 What do my gene results mean?</h4>
<p>
    Your results show two things:
    <ul>
        <li>Your gene versions (called <span style="font-weight: bold;">genotype</span>): You have two copies for one gene, one from your mom and one from your dad. One gene copy is called an "allele".</li>
        <li>How your genes affect your body (called <span style="font-weight: bold;">phenotype</span>): in PGx (pharmacogenomics), it usually shows if a gene version might cause a bad reaction to a medication or how fast your body processes a drug.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>2.6 Which medications does PharMe include?</h4>
<div class="disclaimer">
    <div class="disclaimer-icon-container">
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-pills pills-icon-with-sub-icon"></i>
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-circle disclaimer-sub-icon-background pills-sub-icon-background"></i>
        <i class="fa-classic fa-solid fa-circle-check disclaimer-sub-icon pills-sub-icon"></i>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="disclaimer-text">PharMe includes medications that are known to be affected by genes. We get this information from clinical guidelines from CPIC and the FDA.</p>
        <p class="disclaimer-text" style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 1em;">
            While only a small percentage of medications have CPIC or FDA guidelines, they are among the most commonly prescribed medications.
            If you cannot find a medication in PharMe, there may not be enough evidence for clinically relevant gene interactions.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Some examples are medications for:
</p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
    <li>Blood clots</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>High cholesterol</li>
    <li>Acid reflux</li>
    <li>Pain</li>
    <li>Fungal infections</li>
    <li>Immune system</li>
    <li>Cancer</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.7 Can other medications affect how my body processes medications?</h4>
<p>
    Yes. Some medications can change how your body handles other medications. They can slow down or speed up how your body processes medications.
</p>
<p>
    Medications that slow down how your body processes medications are called <span style="font-style: italic;">inhibitors</span>.
    Medications that speed these processes up are called <span style="font-style: italic;">inducers</span>.
    They can have a strong, moderate, or weak effect on genes.
</p>
<p>
    PharMe will warn you when a current medication has an effect on how your
    body processes medications.
</p>
<p>
    If you are taking any of the below medications, PharMe will show an asterisk
    (*) next to affected gene results and explain how it changes the processing
    of other medications.
    Consult your pharmacist or doctor for more information in such cases.
</p>
<p>PharMe currently only includes strong and moderate inhibitors for the gene
    <em>CYP2D6</em>:
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Strong inhibitors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bupropion (brand names: Aplenzin, Auvelity, Budeprion, Contrave, Forfivo, Wellbutrin, Zyban)</li>
    <li>Fluoxetine (brand names: Act Fluoxetine, Prozac, Sarafem, Symbyax)</li>
    <li>Paroxetine (brand names: Paxil, Pexeva)</li>
    <li>Quinidine (brand names: Nuedexta)</li>
    <li>Terbinafine (brand names: Lamisil, Silka Cream)</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Moderate inhibitors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abiraterone (brand names: Yonsa, Zytiga)</li>
    <li>Cinacalcet (brand names: Sensipar, Mimpara)</li>
    <li>Duloxetine (brand names: Cymbalta, Drizalma, Irenka, Yentreve)</li>
    <li>Lorcaserin (brand names: Belvia)</li>
    <li>Mirabegron (brand names: Myrbetriq)</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.8 Are my results relevant for my family?</h4>
<p>
    Yes. Since genes run in families:
    <ul>
        <li>You got your genes from your parents</li>
        <li>Your children will get some of their genes from you</li>
        <li>Your brothers and sisters might have similar genes</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>2.9 Who should I share my results with?</h4>
<p>Share your results with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your doctors</li>
    <li>Your pharmacists</li>
    <li>Close family members</li>
</ul>
